== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are there additional options I can use? =

Yes, under the Splide Carousel block Advanced Settings, you can provide a valid JSON string containing additional options [located here](https://splidejs.com/guides/options/).

e.g.: `{"focus":"center","trimSpace":false}`

= Can I set default carousel options globally? =

Yes, we need to listen to a JavaScript event that is fired when the carousel is ready, and then add the defaults.

`document.addEventListener( 'splideReady', function( e ) {
    e.detail.defaults = {
        arrowPath: 'M30.2 19.4L11 .2c-.3-.3-.9-.3-1.2 0-.3.3-.3.8 0 1.2L28.4 20 9.8 38.6c-.3.3-.3.9 0 1.2.3.3.9.3 1.2 0l19.2-19.2c.3-.3.3-.9 0-1.2z',
        perPage: 3
    };
} );`

= Can I control the carousel using JavaScript / API? =

Yes, each carousel is given a unique ID by default, or you can provide your own using the **HTML Anchor** field under the block Advanced Settings.

Each block exposes a global variable that follows this convention: `{ID}Carousel`. For example, if your carousel ID is **testimonials**, the global variable will be `testimonialsCarousel`.

Using this global variable, you can control the carousel programatically using the [Splide API](https://splidejs.com/guides/apis/).

**Example to navigate to the third slide:**

`testimonialsCarousel.Components.Controller.go(2);`
